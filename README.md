# Fixdows
Fixdows is a tool made in C# to repair common issues among Windows computers.
# How to build
Install VS 2019, make sure you have .NET development selected in the installer.
From there, just get the repo from here, and then build. Make sure you move the assets folder to your build's folder if you plan on distributing it, otherwise scripts wont work.
