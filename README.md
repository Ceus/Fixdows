# Fixdows
Fixdows is a tool made in C# to repair common issues among Windows computers.
## How to build
- Install VS 2019. Make sure you have .NET Development selected in the installer.
- From there, just clone the repo from here, and then build it. Make sure you move the `assets` folder to your build's folder if you plan on distributing it, otherwise scripts won't work.
